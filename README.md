# Autism_prediction_using_ML
🧠 Autism Prediction using Machine Learning
->Developed a predictive system to classify individuals as autistic or non-autistic based on behavioral and demographic attributes.
->Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of ~700 records with 17 features (handled outliers, missing values, and categorical encoding).
->Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and conducted EDA to uncover correlations and feature importance.
->Trained and tuned Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models via RandomizedSearchCV (5-fold cross-validation).
->Achieved a test accuracy of 92% using the XGBoost classifier, outperforming baseline models.
->Saved encoders and the best model as Pickle files for future deployment.
